# green-paths

Green Paths is an open source route planner being developed in Digital Geography Lab, University of Helsinki, currently in the project [UIA HOPE](https://ilmanlaatu.eu/briefly-in-english/) â€“ Healthy Outdoor Premises for Everyone funded by [Urban Innovative Action](https://www.uia-initiative.eu/en/uia-cities/helsinki). Its goal is to inform people on fresh air and quiet routes for walking and cycling in Helsinki region. 

It utilizes Air Quality Index (AQI) data from the [FMI-ENFUSER](https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/environmental-information-fusion-service) modelling system (by the Finnish Meteorological Institute) and modelled [traffic noise data](www.syke.fi/en-US/Open_information/Spatial_datasets/Downloadable_spatial_dataset#E) from the Helsinki capital region. AQI is based on real-time hourly data as a composite measure of NO2, PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and O3. 

Currently implemented features include calculation of unpolluted and quiet paths for both walking and cycling with respect to real-time air quality and typical (day-evening-night time) noise levels from road and rail traffic. The exposure-based routing method (and application) is based on [an MSc thesis](https://github.com/hellej/quiet-paths-msc).

* See also [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
* Please bear in mind that the current objective of the project is to develop a proof-of-concept of a green path route planner rather than a production ready service
* You are most welcome to add feature requests or bug reports in the issue trackers of the related projects
* When contributing to the project, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change (firstname.lastname@helsinki.fi)
* Simple typo fixes etc. can be sent as PRs directly, but for features or more complex bug fixes please add a corresponding issue first for discussion
